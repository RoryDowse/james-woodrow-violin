            <p class="testimonial-text">James is an experienced and enthusiastic violin teacher. He is very organised, patient, and always punctual for lessons. He chooses teaching materials according to Emily&rsquo;s needs and helps her establish a good practice routine. Emily is a quick learner, so he always makes sure she gets challenged but without pressure. Last Summer, before her 10th birthday, she passed ABRSM grade 6 with distinction. Her quality of playing has improved amazingly, and she is currently preparing for her grade 7 exam. Emily is playing more and more confidently, and always leaves her lessons with a smile!</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">My daughter has been having violin lessons with James for the past 2 years. She started as a complete beginner aged 8 and under James&rsquo; guidance has achieved a Distinction in Grade 2 ABRSM violin exam. She is currently preparing for Grade 3 Violin exam. Clearly amazing progress for 2 years of learning! James is able to explain technical musical terms in a simple manner that my daughter can easily grasp. He is very patient with student children. As a teacher, James is very professional and always punctual. My daughter always looks forward to her Violin lessons.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">I met James when he came to stand in for our conductor at The Lowry String Group. I was so impressed, that he was my first choice of teacher when I needed to change. He&rsquo;s extremely professional, friendly, knowledgeable and thoughtful. As a result I believe my playing is improving immensely. I really look forward to my lessons and feel very fortunate to be taught by him.</p>

            <p id="testimonial-name" class="right">Anne (Adult Student)</p>
            <p class="testimonial-text">James is a great teacher. I returned to lessons after a long break at about grade 5 standard and he has really helped me improve my technique and playing in general. He is always encouraging and supportive and is great at identifying solutions to any difficulties I&rsquo;m having and suggesting the most useful ways to practise. I was very happy to achieve grade 8 violin last year and now have more confidence playing in a group and learning more advanced pieces. I really enjoy lessons and would highly recommend James as a teacher.</p>
